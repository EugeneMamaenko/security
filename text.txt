Add the capacity to decipher polyalphabetic cipher, named the 'Vigenere' cipher. Your program should discriminate this type of algorithm from monoalphabetic ones using any test of goodness of fit you are comfortable with. You may use index of coincidence 'Kasiski', examination statistical tests or whatever method you feel will show the best result. Try to think of what will happen if the key contains same characters at different positions. Will your program still behave correctly?
